## CondaNest

 A fast, minimal GTK4 desktop app for **managing, and cleaning Conda/Mamba environments** on Linux.  
CondaNest gives you a single, focused window to see which envs exist, what they contain, and how much disk space they use – without touching your shell config.

### Why?

- **Conda envs sprawl**: after a while it’s hard to remember what’s where, which env is active, or what’s safe to delete.
- **CLI is powerful but noisy**: `conda env list`, `conda clean`, `conda config` all have many flags and different outputs.
- **Linux‑native UX**: most Conda tooling is web‑ or CLI‑only; CondaNest is a small Libadwaita app that feels at home on modern GNOME desktops.

### Features (current prototype)

- **Environment list** with name, path and approximate disk usage.
- **Per‑env actions**: clone, rename (clone‑then‑remove), delete, export to `environment.yml`.
- **Bulk tools**: export all envs to YAML, create multiple envs from a folder of YAMLs.
- **Janitor**: estimate Conda disk usage and run `conda clean --all` from a simple dialog.
- **Channel management**: reorder global channels and toggle strict priority.

### Quick start (development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aradar46/condanest.git
cd CondaNest
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -e .
condanest
```

### Downloadable AppImage

For users who don’t want to set up Python or a venv, CondaNest is also shipped as a self‑contained **AppImage** (`CondaNest-x86_64.AppImage`) on the GitHub Releases page.

```bash
chmod +x CondaNest-x86_64.AppImage
./CondaNest-x86_64.AppImage
```

This bundles CondaNest and its Python dependencies in an internal virtualenv. Your system still needs GTK4/Libadwaita + PyGObject installed as listed in the requirements above.

### Requirements

- **OS**: Linux (X11 or Wayland), GNOME / Libadwaita recommended
- **Python**: 3.10+
- **System packages** (installed via your distro, not pip):
  - GTK4 + Libadwaita runtime and introspection data
  - PyGObject bindings (`gi`)

On Debian/Ubuntu, you typically need:

- `python3-gi`
- `gir1.2-gtk-4.0`
- `gir1.2-adw-1`
On other distros, install the equivalent GTK4/Libadwaita and PyGObject packages from your package manager.
